# SQ1OptimalPath
Intention: To calculate optimal path between origin and destination of customer within the mall.

Ideally for now, we just want to represent every landmark with a vertex and use edges to connect them. 
For now, I think I weigh the vertices on the top floor differently.. and the output to just print out all the vertices between origin and destination once the optimal
path has been calculated.

So something like
Optimal_Path('TD Bank', 'Left side Food Court')
"TD Bank -> BestBuy -> SQ1 Circle -> Left side Food Court.
